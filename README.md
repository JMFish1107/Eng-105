# Eng-105
These materials are CSV files and Python Notebooks created for the "Writing in the Natural Sciences" unit project of Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 section of ENGL-105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HIll

This compository contains 1 Python notebook and 2 CSV files: 
1. The original "County Health Data" dataset (CSV)
2. The notebook including needed documentations in order to sift through the County Health data (Python Notebook)
3. The finished product that one should have at the end of the instructional notebook (CSV)

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library.  

Overview Notes: 
- Provenance: All data came from the "County Health Data" dataset and all coding involved is a product of Prof. Gotzler's instruction in his ENGL-105 class.  
- Purpose: This data is for those looking to analyze the correlation between economic aspects of a humans life, such as Unemployment and Income inequality, and educational aspects such as a High school graduation rate.  
- Potential: This repo was made in order for the process of analyzing the previously stated correlation to be easily replicated across any and could, in theory, be replicated across all couties to cull together a national correlation. 

Data Visualization:

- For practical uses, this visualization shows the positive relationship between the factors "High school graduation", "Unemployment", and "Income inequality" in terms of quantitative data.  As far as potential use, this visualization could be used by individuals to make the arguement that highschool graduation rates and unemployment rates are two crucial, tangible elements involved in controlling the much more intricate concept of income inequality.
