These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library.  

Conclusive Notes: 
- Provenance: All data came from the "County Health Data" dataset and all coding involved is a product of Prof. Gotzler's instruction in his ENGL-105 class.

- Potential: This repo was made in order for the process of analyzing the previously stated correlation to be easily replicated across any and could, in theory, be replicated across all couties to cull together a national correlation.
